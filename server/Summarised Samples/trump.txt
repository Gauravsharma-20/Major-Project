WASHINGTON - The Trump administration has ordered the military to start withdrawing roughly 7,000 troops from Afghanistan in the coming months, two defense officials said Thursday, an abrupt shift in the 17-year-old war there and a decision that stunned Afghan officials, who said they had not been briefed on the plans.President Trump made the decision to pull the troops - about half the number the United States has in Afghanistan now - at the same time he decided to pull American forces out of Syria, one official said.The announcement came hours after Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, said that he would resign from his position at the end of February after disagreeing with the president over his approach to policy in the Middle East.The whirlwind of troop withdrawals and the resignation of Mr. Mattis, he begrudgingly pledged an additional 4,000 troops to the Afghan campaign to try to hasten an end to the conflict.Though Pentagon officials have said the influx of forces - coupled with a more aggressive air campaign - was helping the war effort, Afghan forces continued to take nearly unsustainable levels of casualties and lose ground to the Taliban.The renewed American effort in 2017 was the first step in ensuring Afghan forces could become more independent without a set timeline for a withdrawal
