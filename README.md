# EVACOL - Evaluation and Collaboration Platform

## Model Type: Website and App

## Technology: MERN (website), React Native (app)

## Overview:
 Online dev collaboration platform which provides an environment for all students and freelance developers to collaborate online for various projects related to computer science. Users can collaborate by searching projects related to certain technologies and after being a partner of a team, they can chat, have meetings, can set deadlines, and have meeting notes and reminders. 
 
 System will also provide evaluators several features through which they can supervise all the projects and finally evaluate the performance using the necessary metrics and tools.

## Relevance:
 There is no online platform where developers can randomly collaborate in a project as they like and have all the tools at one place needed for that collaboration and no proper metric other than the final 15-20 mins presentation to evaluate students.


## Features: 
This is a list of all currently speculated features.
* Home page of the website will provide us with options of login (via 3rd party api also) and registration.
* If not logged in, users can see random active projects being developed right now, users can see the details of each project, the difficulty level, technologies used, how active are the members in each project, the members of the team.
* Users can also see the profile of different users active on the website (like codechef).
Users if logged in can see the same things, plus their active projects on the top and the classrooms that they are a part of.
* They can search for projects or classrooms created by certain other users, or in which some other users are a part of, by project ids, by difficulty or by technologies used.
* Project owners can set the settings that do they need more members or not.
* Users will send requests to be a part of some project, and if approved the user will be added to the project.
* Members of a project can chat, have meetings (which can be recorded), can have reminders, notes, scheduler (like jira). (All components are made from scratch mostly).
* We will also link the github repo of the project in the team.
* A user can also create a classroom in which the members of the classroom(students) can join the classroom with joining links or other access privileges (which can be decided). Students(users) can also create group projects inside the classroom just like outside the classroom, but they will only be scoped to that classroom and not publicly available (or as deemed fit by the classroom owner).
* The evaluator can add more evaluators and can see graphs and charts which will assist in evaluating any group’s performance. They can see the commit percentage, %age change per person averaged over all commits, github api’s can be used. Other metrics can be added as and when required.
* Maybe projects can be monetised, in a way that some companies can organise hackathons on it or be used on subscription basis by colleges.
